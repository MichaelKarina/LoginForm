# 🖥️ Modern Login and Registration Form

This project showcases a sleek, modern login and registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is designed with smooth transitions, stylish icons, and an engaging user experience.

## 🌐 HTML Structure

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type as HTML5.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata, links to external stylesheets (like Font Awesome for icons), and the document's title.
- **`<body>`**: The main content area, including:
  - A `<div>` with the class `Form-box` that contains two forms: one for login and one for registration.
  - Each form has input fields (for email, password, username), icons from Font Awesome, and buttons for submitting the forms.

## 🎨 CSS Styling

### **Body Styling**
- A full-screen background image that covers the entire viewport, giving a visually appealing backdrop to the form.

### **Form Styling**
- The form is centered on the page with a semi-transparent background and a blur effect for a sleek appearance.
- White text ensures good readability against the background.
- Smooth transitions and animations enhance user interaction.
- Focus effects are applied to input labels, moving them above the input field when the field is focused or filled.

### **Transitions**
- The form smoothly switches between the login and registration forms using CSS transitions.
- This transition is triggered by adding or removing the `change-form` class on the `Form-box` div.

## 🚀 JavaScript Interactivity

### **Form Switching**
- JavaScript enables toggling between the login and registration forms when the "Register" or "Login" buttons are clicked.
- This functionality is achieved by adding or removing the `change-form` class on the `Form-box` div, ensuring a smooth user experience.
